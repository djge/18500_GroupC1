Sunlight often serves as an annoyance to people by obstructing their vision, and adversely affecting their visual comfort, eye health, and productivity. However, completely eliminating natural light has been shown to negatively impact a person’s mood and mental health. To combat this issue, our project aims to create a system that will eliminate the manual process of turning blinds, and optimize a room’s lighting. The system will automatically close certain blinds if it detects sunlight hitting a person in the room.
